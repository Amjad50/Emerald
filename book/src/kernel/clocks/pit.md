# Programmable Interval Timer (PIT)

> This is implemented in [`pit`][kernel_pit].

> See OsDev docs [OsDev: Programmable Interval Timer (PIT)][PIT_docs] for more details.

The PIT is a hardware timer chip that is commonly used in x86-based systems to generate periodic interrupts and measure time intervals.

Its kinda a lesser version of [HPET], but it has wider support. We are using it as an alternative to [HPET]
if its not present or the user doesn't want to use it by using the `allow_hpet=false` cmdline (see [Command Line])

We are using `PIT` as a timer to keep track of system ticks and also to calibrate [TSC] when [HPET] isn't used,
so we are not using the interrupts generated by PIT for anything else.
