# Drivers

This will cover all drivers that interact with hardware.

We may call it `drivers` or `devices`. For now at least, we treat them as the same thing.

Some of these devices and [virtual devices](../virtual_devices/index.md) may be available as `devices` in the [filesystem](../filesystem/index.md#devices).
